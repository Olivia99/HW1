FURTHER EXPLANATION

DIRECTION1 IS A VARIABLE COMMAND.
WHEN YOU RUNNING THE "GET COLOR" CODE, IF GET COLOR IS RED, GOING UP;
IN THIS CASE THE DIRECTION1 REFERS TO DIRECTION GOING UP;
SO THE WHOLE CODE WOULD BE:

RIGHT
GET COLOR (GET RED COLOR)
	IF GETCOLOR IS RED, UP
	IF GETCOLOR IS BLUE, DOWN
	SAVE DIRECTION1 (GOING UP)
DIRECTION1 (GOING UP)
DIRECTION1 (GOING UP)
GET COLOR
	IF GETCOLOR IS RED, LEFT
	IF GETCOLOR IS BLUE, RIGHT
DIRECTION1 (GOING UP)

ON THE CONTRARY, IF GET COLOR IS BLUE, THEN THE DIRECTION1 REFERS TO GOING DOWN.
